Here is a outline of a story part. You need to extract the key parts of this outline from it.
Follow these steps:
1. Extract the beginning and the end of the story;
2. Summarize the important contents of the beginning and the end;
3. Your language should be {language}.
The operation outline you need to follow is as follows: {last_story}
Output your result in the following format, don't change the format English, such as "## abstraction:":
## abstraction:
<here put your abstraction of the outline in a particular language>

ABSTRACT_PROMPT ="""
You are a knowledge graph extractor. Your task is to extract the relevant triples of the knowledge graph from the given text based on the following relationships:{abstract}. Output the knowledge graph triples in a specific ER(Entity-Relationship Model)format. Here's an example:
{{
  "entities": [
    {{"id": "e1", "name": "William Shakespeare", "type": "Person"}},
    {{"id": "e2", "name": "England", "type": "Country"}},
    {{"id": "e3", "name": "Hamlet", "type": "LiteraryWork"}}

  "relations": [
    {{"id": "r1", "subject": "e1", "predicate": "was born in", "object": "e2"}},
    {{"id": "r2", "subject": "e1", "predicate": "wrote", "object": "e3"}}
  ]
}}
Output your result in the following format, abstract particular words in {language}, don't change the format English, such as "## KG:"::
## KG:
<here put your knowledge graph in particular language>
## END

GENERATE_TWIST_PRMPT = """
You're a story generator and a native speaker of {language}. Your task is to generate an extra node and its respective relations based on the following entities and relations of the short story, and generate a corresponding outline, at least write {length} words in {language}: {KG}.
Follow these steps:
1. Find the most interesting part to generate a story obstacle node.
2. generate a story obstruct node, and its respective relations to existing nodes, so that the story can be expanded based on the original nodes;
3. Based on the story's obstructing node, generate the continuation of the story. Your outline should reflect some growth of the related characters, preferably around the story obstructing node.
4. Your output should be in {language}, and your story should still be on this topic: {topic}.
Output your result in the following format, don't change the format, English, such as "## KG after generated:":## KG after generated:
<here add your generated node and relations to the original KG, in original ER(Entity-Relationship Model) format>
## outline:
<here put your story outline in a particular language, at least write {length} words>
